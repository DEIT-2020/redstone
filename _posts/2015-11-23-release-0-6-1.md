Hey everyone!
 
I'm very glad to announce that we've just released the version 0.6.1, which includes a re-write that Luis started a while ago.

It's been a long time since we've released something, but this [has been through voting](https://github.com/redstone-dart/redstone/issues/136), and went through!

__Breaking Change__ 
Note that this version requires a minimum Dart SDK version of 1.13.0. This is due to the [new Boring SSL update in the SDK](http://news.dartlang.org/2015/09/dart-adopts-boringssl.html).

Please note that more breaking changes were introduced since v0.5, these are listed in the [CHANGELOG](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/redstone). [Documentation pages](http://redstonedart.org/doc/index) have been updated accordingly.


Many users have confirmed using the version 0.6.0-beta in production and things went fine.

If you end up having problems with this release, please file an issue at our [GitHub](https://github.com/luizmineo/redstone.dart) page.

We'll be glad to help you and improve Redstone.dart.

As a side note, I would like to thank everyone who contributed, Redstone.dart is now community-driven. Your input and contributions are more than welcome!
